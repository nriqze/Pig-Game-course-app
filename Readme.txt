Two players that can play against each other or against the pc
Roll dice and the number is added to the score of the player.
Have two button, one to roll the dice and another to add the current score to the score of the player and the score is reset to zero.
When we roll one, we loose our current score (become zero) and it's the other player turn. Thats why we 
hold the score.
The first player to reach 100 points, wins.
